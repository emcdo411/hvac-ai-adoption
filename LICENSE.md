## 5. Patent Peace (Defensive Term)
We grant you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free **patent license** to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise run the Software and Derivatives.

This patent license **terminates** immediately for any Licensee (and affiliates) who initiate or financially support a **patent claim** or proceeding alleging that the Software or a contribution to it infringes a patent—**unless** the claim is purely defensive (responding to a suit or a credible, written threat first asserted against you).

  *“Powered by components from HVAC AI Adoption (DACR License), © 2025 emcdo411.”*

## 7. Termination & Cure
- This license **automatically terminates** if you breach Sections 4 or 5.  
- For other breaches, you have **30 days** after notice to cure; if cured, rights are reinstated automatically.  
- Upon termination, you must stop all Production Use and distribution; internal backup copies may be retained for legal and archival purposes only.
